Welcome to OpenFurther
----------------------

OpenFurther is an informatics platform that supports federation and integration 
of data from heterogeneous and disparate data sources. 

It has been deployed at the University of Utah (UU) as the Federated Utah Research and 
Translational Health e-Repository (FURTHeR) since August 2011 and is available for use 
by all U of U employees and students. OpenFurther links heterogeneous data types, 
including clinical, public health, biospecimen and patient-generated data; empowering 
researchers with the ability to assess feasibility of particular clinical 
research studies, export biomedical datasets for analysis, and create aggregate databases 
for comparative effectiveness research. With the ability to link unique individuals 
from these sources, OpenFurther is able to identify cohorts for clinical research. 

It provides semantic and syntactic interoperability as it federates health information 
on-the-fly and in real-time and requires neither data extraction nor homogenization by 
data source partners, facilitating integration by retaining data in their native 
format and in their originating systems.

OpenFurther is built upon Maven, Spring, Hibernate, ServiceMix, and other open source 
frameworks that promote FURTHeR's code reusability and interoperability.
